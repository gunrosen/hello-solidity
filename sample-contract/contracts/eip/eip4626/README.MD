### EIP 4626 - Yield-bearing token or Interest-bearing token

Example: stETH, xSUSHI, cUSDC

Lido Finance: 

+ Stake 1 ETH, we received 1 stETH => (1 stETH=1 ETH)
+ Time goes by, stETH can be higher price, maybe 1 stETH=1.05 ETH, 5% after a year
+ stETH is yield-bearing token

stETH then 
+ Provide liquidity for Curve, 1inch, Uniswap, Blancer
+ Lending: Anchor, AAVE
+ Use in Aggregation: Harvest Finance

So we have many yield-bearing token in a single protocol. Rewrite, maintain and audit spend much time and cost
